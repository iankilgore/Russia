</p>

<h2>The Russian federation</h2>
<p>
Modern-day Russia is a federal republic, led by its president, Vladimir Putin
Putin works with a bi-cameras legislative body known as the Duma
This has been its form of government since 1989 when its communist regime ended after losing a fifty-year conflict with the U.S. Called the Cold War
Russia spans nine time zones in Eastern Europe/northern Asia
its population of approximately 144 million people is 9th most in the world
The main ethnic group of early Russia: The Slavs, who came from the Indo-Europe region and settled on the icy <a href="#steppes" onclick="showPopup(300,150,'steppes_definition');" >steppes.</a>
</p>



<h2>ENTER THE Vikings</h2>

<p>Vikings end up in Russia to trade, rather than plunder in 9th century AD...<br>
Russia derives its name from the Rus tribe of Vikings that rose to fame and trade power<br>
By 911 AD, Russia has been established as a trade Mecca, organized a treaty with Byzantine Empire...<br>

<ul>
	<li>From GREECE: Gold, clothes, wine, fruit</li>
	<li>From the CZECHS and HUNGARIANS: silver and horses</li>
	<li>From RUSSIA: fur, wax, honey, and slaves</li>
</ul>

<p>Vikings become Russians when Prince Vladimir selects Greek-Orthodox as national religion, which is still the most widely-practiced religion in the country today</p>

<p>Russian power lies largely in city of Kiev until the 12th century when power shifts north to Moscow (thanks to Mongol influence)</p>

<p>History's exception: Mongols conquer Kiev in 1240, called the "Golden Horde" named so for the golden tent the Mongol leader, Batu Khan, stayed in...</p>

<h2>Mongol rule</h2>

<p>Mongols rule Russian cities (Kiev, Moscow, Vladimir), though they allow Russian princes to retain political power as long as they pay tribute (tax revenue)<br>
Mongol capital is established long the Volga River Batu Khan named the city Sarai Batu<br>
Batu's brother makes Islam the official religion of the Mongols, <a href="#mosque" onclick="showPopup(300,150,'mosque_definition');" >mosques</a> and bath houses are built</p>



<p>
Traditional Mongol social structure was based on the family and it was a <a href="#patriarchy"
onclick="showPopup(300,150,'patriarchy_definition');">patriarchy</a> </p>


<br>
<p>Mongols were <a href="#nomadic"
onclick="showPopup(300,150,'nomadic_definition');">nomadic</a> wanderers of the land that formed clans, then larger tribes</p>



<p>When tribes started to unite, the strongest leader was known as Khan (a monarchical title)
The most famous and strongest Khan? Genghis Khan (1162-1227) conquered much territory around northern China and fathered so many children, it is believed that approximately 1 of every 200 or so Chinese and Mongolian men are indirectly related to Genghis Khan</p>

<p>The Mongols owed their military success to a few characteristics: mobility, organization, and ferocity</p>

<h2>Mongol Characteristics</h2>

<dl>
	<dt>Mobile:</dt>
	<dd>Besides being nomadic and thus invulnerable to any attack on their 'homeland', Mongol soldiers were also expert fighters on horseback<br>Mongol soldiers were expected to maintain at least three horse for battle</dd>
	<dt>Organized:</dt>
	<dd>Commanders in the Mongol army knew the value of when to attack en masse (all at once) and when to 'divide and conquer'<br>Mongol troops could attack in a large, coordinated way or they could break into small groups that would encircle and ambush foes... This flexible was a massive advantage</dd>
	<dt>Ferocity:</dt>
	<dd>Mongol military leaders were masters of psychological warfare, deception, and terror. Their tactics ranged from offering cities a chance to avoid being ransacked by paying tribute before an attack... Knowing an established town would not be willingly burned or abandoned When the Mongols did destroy a city, they allowed a few citizens to remain alive to tell the story of the brutality of what had transpired.</dd>

<h3>3/19/2015</h3>
<p>Russian Mongols thrive until 1395 when Russians led by Ivan III finally eliminate Mongols<br>
Ivan III (or Ivan the Great) takes an important step: for the first time in more than 200 years, the grand prince of Moscow refuses to pay the annual tribute of tax to the Golden Horde<br>
The Mongol Khan marches against Moscow, but withdraws without a fight. This important symbolic moment enables Ivan III to present himself internationally as the free sovereign an independent state<br>
RUSSIA IS NO LONGER ANSWERING TO MONGOL RULE!</p>
<h1>Ivan the great</h1>
<p>After Ivan shakes off the Mongols by refusing tribute, he further consolidates the power of Moscow by buying or conquering other parts of the Mongol hold on Russia and assumes autocratic rule<br>
Additionally, Ivan is the first Russian ruler who calls himself "tsar" (or czar) as a call to the power of Caesar, from where the word is derived.</p>
