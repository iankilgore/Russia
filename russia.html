ENTER THE Vikings
Vikings end up in Russia to trade, rather than plunder in 9th century AD...
Russia derives its name from the Rus tribe of Vikings that rose to fame and trade power
By 911 AD, Russia has been established as a trade Mecca, organized a treaty with Byzantine Empire...
From GREECE: Gold, clothes, wine, fruit
From the CZECHS and HUNGARIANS: silver and horses
From RUSSIA: fur, wax, honey, and slaves
Vikings become Russians when Prince Vladimir selects Greek-Orthodox as national religion, which is still the most widely-practiced religion in the country today

Russian power lies largely in city of Kiev until the 12th century when power shifts north to Moscow (thanks to Mongol influence)

History's exception: Mongols conquer Kiev in 1240, called the "Golden Horde" named so for the golden tent the Mongol leader, Batu Khan, stayed in...

Mongol rule
Mongols rule Russian cities (Kiev, Moscow, Vladimir), though they allow Russian princes to retain political power as long as they pay tribute (tax revenue)
Mongol capital is established long the Volga River Batu Khan named the city Sarai Batu
Batu's brother makes Islam the official religion of the Mongols, mosques and bath houses are built

Mosque: Islamic temple of Worship

Traditional Mongol social structure was based on the family and it was a patriarchy
Patriarchy: Male is the farther-figure and leader
Mongols were nomadic wanderers of the land that formed clans, then larger tribes
Nomadic: they moved around to survive, rather than establish a set homeland
When tribes started to unite, the strongest leader was known as Khan (a monarchical title)
The most famous and strongest Khan? Genghis Khan (1162-1227) conquered much territory around northern China and fathered so many children, it is believed that approximately 1 of every 200 or so Chinese and Mongolian men are indirectly related to Genghis Khan
The Mongols owed their military success to a few characteristics: mobility, organization, and ferocity
Mobile: Besides being nomadic and thus invulnerable to any attack on their 'homeland', Mongol soldiers were also expert fighters on horseback
Mongol soldiers were expected to maintain at least three horse for battle
Organized: Commanders in the Mongol army knew the value of when to attack en masse (all at once) and when to 'divide and conquer'
Mongol troops could attack in a large, coordinated way or they could break into small groups that would encircle and ambush foes... This flexible was a massive advantage
Ferocity: Mongol military leaders were masters of psychological warfare, deception, and terror.
Their tactics ranged from offering cities a chance to avoid being ransacked by paying tribute before an attack... Knowing an established town would not be willingly burned or abandoned
When the Mongols did destroy a city, they allowed a few citizens to remain alive to tell the story of the brutality of what had transpired.
